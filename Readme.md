## Description

The Book Search Engine is designed to simplify the process of finding books. It's a project where I enhanced my skills by integrating the MongoDB Server, offering a seamless experience in searching for various books.

## Installation

To set up this application locally, start by cloning this repository to your computer. Then, execute the following commands in the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm run develop
```

After running these commands, your local setup should be up and running, displaying the main page of the Book Search Engine.

## Usage

For those preferring an online version, the application is also hosted on Heroku. Access it through this link: https://rodrigo-book-search-engine.netlify.app/.

Additionally, a tutorial video is available for guidance on how to navigate and utilize the features of the website:
